// @deprecated - Use @features/settings instead
// COMPATIBILITY SHIM: This re-exports the moved component to maintain existing imports
export { BotSettingsPage as default } from '@features/settings';

// Also provide named export for consistency
export { BotSettingsPage } from '@features/settings';
